Image library project for George to practice on.

This project was created as a simple WPF application for practice purposes. The idea is that I will collaborate on the project with my son George, to give him experience of developing on a real(ish) application using the sort of tools and processes that he would encounter in a real software development team.

I built the initial version of the project, but we will extend it together. It's not intended to be production code, so use it at your own risk.
